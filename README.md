## Limitations & Scope

This guide intentionally focuses on the most common scenarios to keep things simple and readable. It does **not** cover:

- ‚ùå Minor name changes (under 18)
- ‚ùå Cases involving marriage or divorce
- ‚ùå People with criminal records
- ‚ùå Land ownership disclosures
- ‚ùå Non-English speakers
- ‚ùå People without a fixed address

**Why these limitations?** I have limited knowledge and I want this guide to be short, clear, and immediately useful for most people. I discuss this more down below.

## About the Author

Hi! I'm [Emma Zimbinski](https://zimbin.ski), a 21-year-old software developer from Minnesota. I went through the name change process in 2025 and was frustrated by how confusing and scattered the information was.

As a trans person, I found the legal system intimidating and the official documentation unclear. There was no single resource that explained what to actually expect. So I made one.

This is the guide I wish I'd had-- straightforward, accurate, and made specifically for trans Minnesotans navigating this process.
