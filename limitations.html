I'll make this page look pretty later.

This guide, the Automatic Form Generator, and the edited PDF's with text boxes are a work in progress. They are not yet complete, and there are many features that are not yet implemented. The following is a list of known limitations:
<br>
    - No support for people who have been married or divorced
    <br>
    - no support for people with children
    <br>
    - no support for people who need to declare criminal history
    <br>
    - no support for people who need to declare that they have land
<br><br>

Out of scope limitations of the guide:
<br>
    - citizenship
    <br>
    - interpreter services
    <br>
    - support for people who are homeless or have no legal address
    <br>
    - filing for your children
<br><br>

Planned updates to the guide
<br>
    - info on background checks for people who have lived in other states
<br><br>

Out of scope limitations are things that are not planned to be added to the guide. These are things that are not currently in the guide, and will not be added in the future. This is not because I think they are not important, but because I have limited time and resources to work on this project. If you would like to help with these features, this project is open source. I am seeking more information on these topics, and would be happy to work with you to add them to a separate page of the guide. The main guide is not intended to be a complete resource, but rather a starting point and brief primer on the process of changing your name in Minnesota. For this reason, I will refer out to other resources in the case of these topics, and will not be adding them to the guide itself.

If you have any questions or suggestions for improvements, please feel free to reach out to me. I am always looking for ways to improve the guide and make it more useful for people, especially trans ones, who are looking to change their name in Minnesota.
