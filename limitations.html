<p><em>I'll make this page look pretty later.</em></p>

<p>
  This guide, the Automatic Form Generator, and the edited PDFs with fillable text boxes are all a work in progress.
  They're not yet complete, and there are still many features that haven't been implemented.
</p>

<h3>❌ Currently Unsupported Scenarios</h3>
<p>These features are not yet available in the form generator or main guide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>People who have been married or divorced</li>
  <li>People with children</li>
  <li>People who need to declare criminal history</li>
  <li>People who need to declare land ownership</li>
</ul>

<h3>🚫 Out of Scope (Not Planned for This Guide)</h3>
<p>
  These topics are not currently covered and will <strong>not</strong> be included in the main guide in the future:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Citizenship or immigration status</li>
  <li>Interpreter services</li>
  <li>Support for people who are unhoused or have no legal address</li>
  <li>Filing on behalf of your children</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This doesn't mean these issues aren't important—just that I have limited time and resources.
  This project is <strong>open source</strong>, and I'm actively looking for collaborators.
  If you'd like to help write about these topics or contribute to a separate section of the guide, please reach out!
</p>

<hr>

<p>
  This guide is meant to be a starting point—not an exhaustive legal resource.
  It's here to help most people (especially trans people) get oriented and take the first steps toward changing their name in Minnesota.
  For anything beyond the scope of this guide, I'll link to external resources where possible.
</p>

<p>
  If you have questions, suggestions, or want to contribute, feel free to reach out.
  I'd love to hear from you, especially if you've gone through this process yourself and want to help others.
