            Changing your legal name in Minnesota might seem daunting, but the process basically boils down to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fill out some forms</li>
            <li>File them with the court</li>
            <li>Get a background check done</li>
            <li>Go to a hearing</li>
            <li>Update your Birth Certificate</li>
            <li>Update records with Social Security Administration</li>
            <li>Update License with DMV</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It's going to take some time, but you can do it little by little <b>:-)</b>

            Each county seems to have their own requirements that change over time. You may need a certified copy of the

            a simple image via email. <b>The exact requirements should be in the <i>"Notice of Case Assignment"</i>
                document.</b> You can ask the judge's chambers for more information.

        <p>If you've lived in another state as an adult, this process will be different. Contact the Bureau of Criminal
            Apprehension for more information.</p>


        <p>You can complete the background check with a 10 minute walk in at the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension
            in St. Paul or you can mail in your form and wait about two weeks. Either way it will cost ~$15.</p>

            After the hearing, the judge will sign the order. You can get a certified copy of this order from the court
            for a small fee (~$14). This is a physical copy, sealed in an envelope, that can be used for official
            purposes. You will need this to change your name on your birth certificate, social security card, and
            driver's license.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can request certified copies of the order by mail, in person, or online. If you are requesting them by
            mail, you will need to include a check for the fee and a self-addressed stamped envelope. If you are
            requesting them in person, you can pay with cash, check, or card.
